IANNS Homework

Hello everyone,

I want to make something clear about the homework submission and the deadline: First of all, ignore the printed ones on the sheet. My plan was that you have one week to finish your homework. Hence, the deadline for homework 1 would be today (29th October, 23:59)*. However, due to the reorganization stuff: It is okay to submit your homework by Wednesday (1st November, 23:59)*.

The deadline for homework 2 is next Sunday (5th November, 23:59)*. This homework starts Monday (30th October). In general, there is the following rule of thumb according to homework deadlines: Let N be the current week number (lecture number). You finish the homework N-1 until Sunday of the current week. Every week I will create an announcement on studIP to make this point very clear. Note that, I will also apply Leon's rule of the late days. Moreover, if there are any problems with the deadline or you need in general more time (one week is not enough) then let me please know!

To make this very clear: You upload your code etc. into your group GitHub repository – not on studIP. On your group GitHub repository you create for each homework a folder called "homework_XX". In the case of formulas etc. which you have written down on a sheet of paper, you can take a picture of it and upload it on GitHub e.g. „Task X.png“ or place all pictures belonging to this homework onto a single PDF file called „Task X.pdf“. Instead of taking a picture of the sheet of paper where is formula is, you can use Latex to create a PDF file. I highly recommend you to get in touch with Latex as early as possible during your study because you will need it later for your thesis, every seminar paper, and the final project report (we talk later about this). See this as a practice ;)
